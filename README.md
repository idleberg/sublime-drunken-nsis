## Description

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) completions for Nullsoft Scriptable Install System ([NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)) supporting commands, macros and plugins that are bundled with NSIS v2.46 (and [3.0a2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%203%20Pre-release/3.0a2/RELEASE.html/view)).

This package irons some of the inconsistencies of the NSIS language, allowing command aliases to be completed into valid syntax (see [usage](#usage) for details.) It is meant as an extension for the basic [NSIS Completions & Snippets](http://github.com/idleberg/NSIS-Sublime-Text) package!

This might or might not be a good idea to improve your NSIS skills. Using this package, you will likely never memorize the correct syntax. But then again, using this you don't have to anymore.

## Installation

### Package Control

1. Make sure you already have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) installed
2. Choose *“Install Package”* from the Command Palette (<kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>)
3. Type *“Drunken NSIS”* and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

With [auto_upgrade](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/settings/) enabled, Package Control will keep all installed packages up-to-date!

### Using Git

1. Change to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory
2. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/idleberg/sublime-drunken-nsis.git 'Drunken NSIS'`

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest [stable release](https://github.com/idleberg/sublime-drunken-nsis/releases)
2. Unzip the archive to your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Usage

In Sublime Text's completion tab, all invalid syntax is prefixed with a `%` symbol (no need to type this!) Press `Tab` to auto-complete into valid syntax.

### Word Order

The order of noun and verb is reversible, you can use a variety of combinations:

* `FileRead`/`ReadFile`
* `ReadINIStr`/`INIStrRead`
* `SectionSetText`/`SetSectionText`
* `LogSet`/`SetLog`
* `FindFirst`/`FirstFind`
* `${FindLine}`/`${LineFind}`
* etc.

Use `Tab` key to jump between fields.

### Prince Versions

Named after the Prince Emulator in Douglas Coupland's [Microserfs](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/microserfs.html), these versions make no difference between `BringToFront`/`Bring2Front` or `Goto`/`Go2`. Again, make use of the `Tab` key to jump between fields.

### Sober NSIS

This package *no longer* ships with “sober” completions. You can restore this functionality by installing the basic [NSIS Completions & Snippets](http://github.com/idleberg/NSIS-Sublime-Text) package.
